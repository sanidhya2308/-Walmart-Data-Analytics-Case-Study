# -Walmart-Data-Analytics-Case-Study
ðŸ“Š Data-Driven Insights for Retail Optimization  This project presents an in-depth analysis of Walmartâ€™s retail performance to identify trends, optimize operations, and drive data-backed business decisions. The analysis applies end-to-end data analytics techniques from data preprocessing to advanced visualization using Python, Power BI, and Tableau
## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Walmartâ€™s historical sales data to uncover insights, identify patterns, and support data-driven decision-making.  
The analysis combines statistical methods, data visualization, and business interpretation to understand factors influencing weekly sales performance across multiple stores.

**Key goals include:**
- Exploring sales trends across stores and time periods  
- Evaluating the impact of holidays, fuel prices, temperature, and unemployment  
- Creating interactive dashboards using Tableau and Power BI  
- Developing actionable recommendations to improve operational efficiency
## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data structure and patterns.  
2. Identify **factors affecting weekly sales**, such as holidays and economic indicators.  
3. Conduct **statistical hypothesis testing** (e.g., ANOVA, correlation).  
4. Build **data visualizations and dashboards** to present insights.  
5. Deliver **business recommendations** for data-driven decision-making.
